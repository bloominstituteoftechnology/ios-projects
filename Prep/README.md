# Preparing for Day 1 of Lambda School's iOS Curriculum

## Preparing Equipment

Your computer should be ready to begin development on day one:

* Your Mac should be running the latest operating system.
* Establish an Apple ID. Visit http://appleid.apple.com.
* Install and run the latest version of Xcode. Visit https://developer.apple.com/download/. Make sure to run Xcode, confirm that it works, and allow it to install supplemental command line tools.
* Confirm that Xcode has installed `git`: open a terminal window (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and entering `git --version` at the command line. You should be running git version 2.18 or later.
* Test the simulator: create a new empty project, compile, and run it.
* Create a free GitHub account. Visit github.com. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeyDJAwTEO8)
* Set up your git identity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5flh0sRGBU) and global ignore file on your computer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fzNSluYjNM). 

## Training

Train before day 1 on these topics:

* Master your basic **Lambda Skills**: Understand how the 15-week iOS curriculum works and be able to use Zoom to communicate with PMs and Instructors.
* Become familiar as possible with your base **iOS tool set**: Xcode, Playground, Simulator, and IB
* Work on your **Swift language competency**. 
* Train your essential **cross-platform skills**: Command line, Version control, Markdown, Being your own expert.

## Cross Platform Skills

### Command Line

The text-based command line is a common platform for most development environments. Learning how to use this text-based interface enables you to interact directly with your computer's file system and access many developer-facing tools. Lambda's track focuses on the bash shell.

* **Explain what the command line is and the advantages it offers** [https://youtu.be/tCrkdcDycjA]
* **Understand, navigate, and use shell history to repeat previous commands** [https://youtu.be/urz7sdC556s]
* **Navigate through the Unix file system and list directory files.** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFh4vbOH81Q]

## Version Control 

Version control manages the distributed development of software, enabling collaboration, safe feature development, and snapshotted backups. Lambda's track uses the git revision control system and GitHub.com hosting.

* **Understand and explain the goals of version control** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKmW0oe_aEU&t=0s]
* **Create a project starting at GitHub** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txRu0pWqR_c]
* **Connect an existing project to GitHub** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ytcVKsSB0]
* **Fork and contribute to a project** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggP3jBpWZwQ]
* **Create good commits** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jO9BUQUcsY]

## Markdown

Markdown defines a plain-text format used across the industry for writing rich text documents. Lambda's track uses the Common Mark standard from commonmark.org.

## Being Your Own Expert

New developers often ask for help, mostly for technical issues, and often for material they are already capable of finding on their own. Finding your own answers and helping yourself is a skill set that nutures your own capabilities. Building these competencies involves insight into understanding what you've already tried, good search skills, and the ability to meticulously self-inspect. Problem solving isn't a human quality one is born with, it is a skill set that is nutured and grown.
